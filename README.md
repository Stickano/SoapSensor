Udp sensor receiver + SOAP Create/Read to/from database

This is a simple example of the possible routing that can be made from a Udp broadcaster -> receiver -> SOAP service -> Database. This was a school issued assignment done over the course of half a day. 

This project includes a little altered version of [this](https://github.com/andersbor/UdpBroadcastSender) Udp broadcaster, and the receiver function is also pretty much based on [this](https://github.com/andersbor/UdpBroadcastReceiver), which comes from the same author (My teacher in case you where wondering). And give the man some credit for the 30 repositories of (mainly) C# examples - A thanks for the freebies is in order.
